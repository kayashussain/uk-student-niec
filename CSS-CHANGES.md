# CSS change log

Every time the look of the site is changed through CSS, a line is added here (newest first), the change is marked in the
code with a comment that starts with `🔴 CSS CHANGED`, and the owner is told at the top of the reply. See `CLAUDE.md`.

To find every marked change in the code, search the project for `CSS CHANGED`.

Format: **date · file · what · from → to · why**

## 2026-11-04 · the rule itself

- Nothing about the look changed. This log and the marking rule were created.
- Earlier CSS changes in the redesign (white/off-white theme, equal status boxes, date cells, filter menu, dropdowns and so
  on) are not marked line by line, because the rule did not exist yet. Their full history is in git:
  `git log -p -- shared/theme.css student-details/style.css`
- The main place where the site's look is controlled is `shared/theme.css`, loaded last on every page.
